# nextjs-study-french-chatgpt

## Description

I have a lot of free time, then I decided to create a project with Next.js || React Native and ChatGPT to teach French.
The project will have two parts:

- A website built with Next.js
- A mobile app built with React Native

### Website Features

Summary: support for multiple languages, user authentication, and chatbot.

First: they will learn French with English.
Second: they can record, listen, and compare their pronunciation with the native speaker. ChatGPT will help them with the pronunciation + suggestion to improve their pronunciation.
Third: they can chat with the chatbot to practice their French.

### Steps

1. Search for design of website
2. Create the website with Next.js
