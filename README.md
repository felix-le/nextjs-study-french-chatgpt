# Learning French with NextJS and ChatGPT

## What's This About?

I've got plenty of free time, so I'm making a project to help people learn French. I'm using Next.js and ChatGPT for this. There are two parts to the project:

- A website made with Next.js
- An app for phones made with React Native

### What's on the Website?

The website helps people learn French in a few different ways:

1. **Different Languages**: People can use the website in different languages.
2. **Log In**: People can sign in to the website to get personalized help.
3. **Talking to a Chatbot**: There's a little robot you can talk to. It helps you practice French.

And here are some special things to help with learning:

- **Practice Activities**: You can practice speaking, listening, and writing in French, with help in English too.
- **Getting Better at Speaking**: You can record yourself speaking and get feedback. The website even compares your speech to native speakers. The robot also gives tips to improve your pronunciation.
- **Chatting with the Robot**: You can have conversations in French with the robot to practice.

### How I'm Doing It

Here's how I'm making this project happen:

1. **Finding a Good Design**: First, I'll look for a nice design for the website.
2. **Building the Website**: Then, I'll use Next.js to create the website. I'll add all the features we talked about.

That's the plan! This project will make learning French fun and easy with NextJS and ChatGPT.
